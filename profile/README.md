*A checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity.*

At whirledlabs, we envision that the XRP protocol will provide the financial rails for the next digital financial system. Inspired by the technology of the XRP protocol in 2020, Ryan Molley founded whirledlabs after developing 7+ applications using the XRP network. Pablo, coming from a BD fintech background, teamed up with Ryan to develop  fintech applications using XRPL payment rails. With the arrival of stablecoins & CBDCs, a Quickbooks-like payments platform is desperately needed to facilitate mass adoption of businesses and the utilization of new forms of XRPL-Native Digital Currencies. This is what inspired us to work on Checksum.

Checksum is a fintech app that will allow businesses to access XRPL-Native payment types and perform  day-to-day financial operations though the XRP ledger such as issuing digital checks, automating payroll, processing invoices, and executing cheap & instantaneous payments. 

Checksum will provide businesses with the infrastructure & management tools they need to onboard onto the XRPL ecosystem, which will accelerate mass adoption.
